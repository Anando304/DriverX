# G2_G_DriversAPP
An intuitive app designed to help drivers simulate the G/G2 driving test in Ontario. 
It works by having the user follow specific driving routes using hands-free turn by turn navigation through the Here Maps API. 
The application reads all the necessary data from the Apps Online Database and displays the information to the user such as speed limits,
upcoming traffic turns and various routes. Through this, users can gain experience to become better drivers and familiarize themselves 
with the common driving routes in their city.

Cities currently include Brampton & Toronto but will continuously expand to cover the GTA and all of Ontario.

API's Used: Here Maps, Firebase Database
